# A simple local password manager

> This is a simple password manager that stores your passwords locally. It is written in Python and uses the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt your passwords. It is a Gui tool that can be used to store and retrieve passwords.>

> DO NOT SHARE YOUR "key.key" FILE WITH ANYONE. IT IS THE KEY TO YOUR PASSWORDS.>

> DO NOT SHARE YOUR "passowords.jsonl" FILE WITH ANYONE. IT IS THE FILE THAT STORES YOUR PASSWORDS. I know they are encrypted, but if someone gets a hold of your key, they can decrypt your passwords.>

> Its not super secure, but it is better than nothing.>

> If you have any suggestions, please let me know.>

> I am not responsible if you manage to expose or lose your passwords.>

> Make sure you do not lose your key file.>

> Make sure to give me credit if you use this code or fork this repo.>

> If you have any questions, please let me know.>

> I am currently working to make this more secure and integrated to your browser, but that might take a while also i was thinking about making custom salting for every user, lmk if i should do that and yes i know the encyption used is not the best, therefore i am working one a better on with the custom salts.>
